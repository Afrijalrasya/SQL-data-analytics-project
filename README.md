## About Me

Hello! I am **Afrijal Rasya Putra**, an Informatics student who is interested in exploring the world of **Data**. Although it's still early in my college journey, I'm excited to learn about how data is processed and turned into meaningful information.

üìå I am currently studying:
- Python basic
- **SQL** and the basics of data manipulation
- Basic concepts of **ETL** and data pipeline workflows

I love learning and exploring new things, especially those related to data. I am currently building my skills gradually and constantly looking for opportunities to grow. I am also open to **internships** or **collaborative projects** that can give me hands-on experience and help my learning process.

üì´ Feel free to connect or discuss-I'd love to learn and grow together!
